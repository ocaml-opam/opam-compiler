NAME
       opam-compiler-create - Create a switch from a compiler source

SYNOPSIS
       opam-compiler create [OPTION]â€¦ SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       There are several ways to specify where to find a compiler:

       Github branch
           user/repo:branch

       Github branch (short form)
           user:branch (repo defaults to "ocaml")

       Github pull request
           user/repo#number

       Github pull request (short form)
           #number (repo defaults to "ocaml/ocaml")

ARGUMENTS
       SOURCE (required)
           Where to fetch the compiler.

OPTIONS
       --configure-command=COMMAND
           Use this instead of "./configure".

       --dry-run
           Do not perform external commands. Print them and continue as if
           they worked.

       --switch=SWITCH_NAME
           Use this name for the switch. If omitted, a name is inferred from
           the source. This name is used as is by opam, so passing "." will
           create a local switch in the current directory.

       --with=FEATURES
           Create a switch with this set of features. For example --with
           flambda,nnp will create a switch with the flambda and
           no-naked-pointers features enabled.

COMMON OPTIONS
       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.

EXIT STATUS
       opam-compiler create exits with:

       0   on success.

       123 on indiscriminate errors reported on standard error.

       124 on command line parsing errors.

       125 on unexpected internal errors (bugs).
